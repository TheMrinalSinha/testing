Unit-Testing:
    Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
    source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

why unit test?
    -> Tests reduce bugs in new features and existing features
    -> tests are good documentation
    -> tests reduce the cost of change
    -> faster debugging
    -> faster development
    -> better design
